This script provides a full suite of Git command aliases for Windows users via the `g.bat` file. It's designed to speed up your Git workflow and make commonly used commands easier to type.

## Usage
1. Place `g.bat` directly in the `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\Scripts\` folder of your system path.
2. Add the folder to your PATH, by open the start menu and search for `Environment Variables`. Once open, select the `PATH` variable, and select `Edit`. In the new window, select `New` and type in `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\Scripts\`, replacing `%USERPROFILE%` with your username. Finally, select `OK` and close the remaining window.
3. Once in your PATH, use the new commands by typing `g <alias>` in your Git-enabled terminal.

**Once installed, you're ready to go!** To test the effectiveness, you can try some commands like the following:
For example, to commit changes and push to a repository:
```bash
g st             # git status
g a file.ext     # git add file.ext
g cm -m "msg"    # git commit -m "msg"
g psm            # git push origin main
```
Alternatively, you could use any other push command, detailed below.
